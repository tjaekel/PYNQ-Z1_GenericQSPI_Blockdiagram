TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks QCLKfb_0 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks QCLKfb_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and QCLKfb_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks QCLKfb_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.011 ns between design_1_i/axi_gpio_0/U0/gpio_core_1/Dual.gpio_Data_Out_reg[4]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/QSPI_top_0/U0/DataShiftOut_reg[27]/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

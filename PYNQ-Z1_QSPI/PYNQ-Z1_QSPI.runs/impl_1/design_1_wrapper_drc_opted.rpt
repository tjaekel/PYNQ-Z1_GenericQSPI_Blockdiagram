2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer spi_sck_iobuf/IBUF (in spi_sck_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer spi_ss_iobuf_0/IBUF (in spi_ss_iobuf_0 macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#1 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO QD_0[0] connects to flops which have these design_1_i/QSPI_top_0/U0/DataShiftIn[27]_i_1_n_0
design_1_i/QSPI_top_0/U0/RD_REG[31]_i_1_n_0 set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#2 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO QD_0[1] connects to flops which have these design_1_i/QSPI_top_0/U0/DataShiftIn[27]_i_1_n_0
design_1_i/QSPI_top_0/U0/RD_REG[31]_i_1_n_0 set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#3 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO QD_0[2] connects to flops which have these design_1_i/QSPI_top_0/U0/DataShiftIn[27]_i_1_n_0
design_1_i/QSPI_top_0/U0/RD_REG[31]_i_1_n_0 set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#4 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO QD_0[3] connects to flops which have these design_1_i/QSPI_top_0/U0/DataShiftIn[27]_i_1_n_0
design_1_i/QSPI_top_0/U0/RD_REG[31]_i_1_n_0 set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>
